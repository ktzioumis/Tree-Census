### Context
New York Cityâ€™s trees shade us in the summer, beautify our neighborhoods, help reduce noise, and support urban wildlife. Beyond these priceless benefits, our urban forest provides us a concrete return on the financial investment we put into it. This return includes stormwater interception, energy conservation, air pollutant removal, and carbon dioxide storage. Our publicly owned trees are as much of an asset to us as our streets, sewers, bridges, and public buildings.

### Content
This dataset includes a record for every tree in New York City and includes the tree's location by borough and latitude/longitude, species by Latin name and common names, size, health, and issues with the tree's roots, trunk, and branches.

### Acknowledgements
The 2015, 2005, and 1995 tree censuses were conducted by NYC Parks and Recreation staff, TreesCount! program staff, and hundreds of volunteers.
